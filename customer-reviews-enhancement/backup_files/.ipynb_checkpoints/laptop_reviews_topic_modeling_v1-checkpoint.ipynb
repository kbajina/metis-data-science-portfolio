       "      <th>i was looking for a lightweight lb or less touch screen windows around the mark laptop for my mom who is a light pc user definitely requiring user support often after purchasing an asus notebook after about hours i was sure this was not the right notebook and i needed to find something better the asus had the centrino processors which turns out run hot so the fan was loud and the laptop would be hot pretty much the whole time and it only had a dual processor even after optimizing it and removing some power consuming apps the poor laptop still seemed to struggle to run plus the screen was tiny not a touch screen hence the price tag after some research attempting to remedy the asus shortcomings i purchased the acer aspire v after going to best buy and actually handling the laptop i was impressed at its weight how slick and well designed it felt and most importantly it felt like a real laptop not a toy like the asus what a great purchase after spending days configuring it and learning the new w os and all these apps ive never handled i am a windows convert and definitely considering buying an acer aspire for myself pros price what a great price for such a loaded laptop paid only a little over design solid notebook slick design with all necessary ports weight light weight about lb with the battery touchpad is a dream you have the mouse click options which are missing on some other notebooks it is sensitive just enough it is not in your way when you type it doesnt jump around your apps when you touch it best of all i did not have to load any additional drivers or updates for the touchpad touch screen although the resolution isnt super high on paper what a great crystal screen love the colors vibrant and clear from the box didnt have to adjust anything and the screen is so well designed for the touch it is sensitive just enough to get you around without many errors in the box laptop power cable basic manual for start up and warranty dongle for vga fan super happy with the low quiet fan and cool laptop all that with a quad processor laptop kudos sound speakers provide loud enough volume for my aging mom with slight hearing issues good clear sound as well unknowns battery dont know have not had the battery below so i dont know how long it would take to drain it performance not sure if this isnt due to everything being new and having to load for the first time but some apps and screens take to seconds to load hoping this would change once everything is configured and used at least once it could also be due to our w inexperience time will tell the laptop does start fast from sleep mode although when you open the top it doesnt start automatically i have to press the power button for it to wake up there is probably a setting somewhere about that but thats not a big issue right now cons probably the only tech spec that is below the rest of the components on this machine is the camera grainy images and video oh well all the rest is great so hard to complain given the price had to install app updates which took several hours the notebook was loaded in nov so by july all loaded apps had new versions pretty much this is not an acer or laptop issue though cant hold it against them since this is something we have to do regardless of what brand and laptop we purchase acercloud is a good idea but boy there was no information about what and how to use it and after loading a bunch of its related apps to the laptop and the mobile devices i had no idea how to move filesphotos from the mobile devices to the laptop just no way to do that based on the few menus in the apps it was super frustrating and even research online on the acer forums was useless after wasting about hours i moved onto skydrive after min and some research it still didnt seem intuitive enough so i did some more experimenting and settled on dropbox what a relief the app came with a short and sweet guide telling me exactly how to load my files from one device to the other and the app itself was pretty intuitive as well and didnt require different apps like the acercloud just one plus it kept giving me more and more free space the more i used it and the more devices i added hope this solves my file sharing needs long term would be great if the touch screen laptops came with a touch pen also makes it so much nicer to browse the screen i used one that came with another purchase i made on amazon again not really an acer issue just a nice to have suggestion other windows bit of a steep learning curve and there were no tutorials or instructions on the laptop or at least not that i easily spotted there is definite initial frustration with the os lasted about days but after installing windows preview version which brings back the start button of sorts after finally finding the control panel it was frustrating hunting for it or accidentally stumbling on it but not knowing how to knowingly get to it i was more and more comfortable with the os and seeing its advantages after moderately learning how to get around myself i setup up the start screen and apps for my mom i then braced myself and showed my mom how to use her new laptop expecting a long drawn session it was quite a surprise to see how well she took to using the touch screen and figured out how to get around she has always had trouble with the mouse pads and even more with the touch pads it was a relief to see that she easily handled the gestures on the screen and learned how to get around surprisingly faster than i expected she loved the screen clarity and the vibrant colors after that i knew i had the right laptop in conclusion i am very impressed with this quiet lightweight hard working crystal clear machine after a bit more tweaking and learning more about the os and the apps i am sure it will be even better will try to provide an update after some longer term use but for now we are definitely in the honeymoon

       "      <th>well its expensive more expensive than any tablet option that ive seen but thats also partially because its on par with a full powered ultrabook in terms of specs here are the specific pros and cons i see pros battery life really can hit hours even though its an i gb sata iii ssd with gb ram with the digitizer its powerful enough to be used as a pretty effective graphic design device rip and flip mode is actually pretty handy when using it as a tablet more so than the hinge less surface pro keyboard battery idea is well engineered and works like the asus tablets the tablets battery is always given charge priority over the keyboard docks battery so when both are plugged in the tablet charges while the kb trickle charges once the tablet is full the kb charges at full speed when docked but unplugged the kb powers the device and transfers its juice to the tablet to recharge its battery you can also plug the kb in by itself to charge the kb docks battery while you continue to use the tablet if you really wanted to you could use the tablet indefinitely and never actually plug it directly into the wall if you alternate using it with the kb dock with vpro rapid boot full hibernation takes less than seconds to restore between pressing the power button and actually getting a useable desktop cold boots pretty close to that sleep restore is instant large multitouch touchpad is actually usable and works very well its on par with the touchpad i had on my macbook pro eraser mouse also works well and is a nice alternative to have for apps that dont work well with touchpads such as games like minecraft well-built hinge design is sturdier than any other similar tablets ive used the kb dock has supplemental cooling so when docked it can run the i at full speed fans in the dock blow through vents in the tablet even when not docked its pretty fast supports intel widi so i picked up a couple adapters two usb ports on the kb dock solid overall build quality something lenovo is well known for good quality speakers loud and clear decent sized stylus and that actually goes inside the tablet when not in use unlike the surface pro intel hd isnt the fastest gpu but when paired with a halfway decent cpu itll run just about anything on the ms store flawlessly and most of my steam library on low to medium settings unlike the atom-based tablets which were always a crapshoot when trying new software ive tested it with dishonored fable skyrim far cry blood dragon assassins creed xcom enemy unknown deus ex human revolution arkham city shogun total war and several other current gen games with the exception of any games that specifically have trouble with intel integrated graphics like the swapper it can run pretty much anything i try on it at least at fps if i turn the detail down low enough mini dp instead of micro hdmi like some models such as the samsung ativ cons fully loaded it probably runs about wifi reception is a little odd it picks up g networks great but n network reception drops off significantly the further you get from the router from the other side of the house i get bars to the g network but as few as bar to the n network even though they are both hosted by the same netgear they had similar issues with the early models that my company received a few months back and the lenovo rep told us that a x version would be available sometime in the future but i have no idea specifically when that might be no sd card slot although id rather use a sata iii external usb hard drive over a slow sd card they had to cut it for space in the final design when docked its a little bit larger and heavier than some ultrabooks the only usb port on the tablet is and is covered when docked with the keyboard no usb ports on the tablet itself actually getting widi to work has been unreliable but i dont know where the problem is on that one yet probably software updates no gps on the wifi model included with mobile broadband only compared to other lenovo laptops that feature rapid charge recharging both batteries to full takes a while total charging time seems to take about to hours or to per battery as is the case with all full windows tablets the battery can drain faster than expected if you are not careful too many background apps may drain your battery prematurely but this is more of a general windows complaint than this device specifically no haswell model today and for all anyone knows there could be one in a week or a year now is a terrible time to buy any device because halfway decent haswells are showing up pretty quickly razer already has a haswell gaming laptop with a discrete gpu that weighs less than lbs really nitpicky cons these are cons that i noticed that are very minor boil down to personal preference or havent been verified as being unsolvable so there may be some equivalent featuresolution while the kb can charge when the tablet isnt attached the usb ports dont appear to charge devices plugged into them if the tablet is not present a battery charge indicator on the kb would be nice without this theres no way to know how charged the kb is without plugging the tablet into it some of the keyboard keys are laid out strangely fn in the far lower left instead of ctrl is a pet peeve of mine the bios allows you to swap ctrl and fn in the lower left to compensate for this observations neither good nor bad but interesting to know when the tablet is flipped all kb input from the docked kb is ignored as is the close lid action since folding the unit updoesnt really close it in this mode this means that if you had a specific power setting mapped to lid close then you cant do that until you flip it back around in the other direction</th>\n",

       "      <th>i got this after a real odyssey searching for a new ultrabook i owned the samsung series npxc and my girlfriend has a macbook air mba so i can also compare them to the yoga at this price the yoga is a great product if you want a great quality ultrabook parts are solid and well made and it is not as fragile as the samsung it is not as light as others but unless you really need an ultraportable like the samsung then the yoga fares well as it weights just lbs more than the mba although it is a little bigger about the latter it is sturdier in some sense than both the mba and samsung the mba actually delivers a good solid feeling the series not much so i felt like you can break it easily especially the hinges of the screen but i feel like i could drop the yoga without having to say goodbye to it i believe this is in lenovo spirit their laptop are renowned to be sturdy and long-lasting good quality control my first the samsung came with a dead pixel the second one had a crappy trackpad which selects things at random while you move the cursor and statics from the speakers and audio output a great touchscreen also in terms of quality of the lcd display ips with decent resolution notice that touchscreens reduce battery performance the samsung has a brighter screen and more battery life especially compared if you use the screen at the same level of brightness that was a drawback for the yoga to me because i dont care about the touchscreen however overall considering features and design quality control and price the yoga wins easily a good keyboard it is not as good as the x carbon but it definitely beats the mba which has a decent keyboard but shallower than the yoga and wins hands down the series stiff shallow and noisy it is relly a great ultrabook for the price with the competition out there at the moment you can also upgrade the ram and ssd easily enough especially the ram its trivial what i would like to see improved in the future in order of importance are battery life if you use brightness and use it constantly i mostly browse type quite a bit coding for example and listening to some music you might even wipe it in just hours thats not awesome the series would last hour longer however the battery is decent dont let yourself down because of this the os and features drains the battery the mba would last hours if it had a touchscreen like this and was running win more brightness and bigger screen the mba has a slightly bigger screen but worse resolution and quality thats for sure an even better keyboard like the x carbon thinkpad with the nipple please i would prefer a metal case in terms of design it would make it just awesome back-lit keyboard note i dont use the touchscreen much but the factor forms are really useful many times you are in a vehicle or on the plane or in a situation where you need to bend the laptop and use it with the screen closer to you taking up less space and such it is really useful i love to use it on the couch and bed as tablet otherwise a little heavy even if you dont love the touchscreen and would rather have a better battery life and lighter product like i do the yoga still wins to such product like mba and samsung because of its features and quality for that competitive price</th>\n",

       "      <th>just bought a unit from a local store i agree with another reviewthe touch screen is a great match with win however i have noticed two issues the keyboard seems to be quite sensitive when i type normally like i would on my old laptop ive noticed that some keystrokes were registered more than once and hence causing certain letters to repeat as a result i have to use backspace often to correct typing errors alternativelyy i could let computer do auto correct butt auto-correct isnt always accurate notice the previous sentence has the extra y and extra t from repeated letters and they were not auto-corrected also the touchpad seems to be loose even with very light tapping with finger tip the touch pad makes some clacky noises as if it may come off i dont know if the touchpad is normal but i am going to stores to try out demo units to see if those touchpads have the same issue  update checked with the store clackyloose touchpad isnt normal but it was easily fixed by tighten two screws on the bottom side underneath the touchpad repeating letters issue while typing is not as severe if i place the unit firmly on a table since its an ultrabook many will do typing in a less-than-optimal position based on my research the sensitivity of the keyboard may be optimized for softtouch typist due to its shallow key travel battery life is about hours on normal mixed use although id wish its longer i can live with it since its such a thin laptop  update put the unit to sleep by closing the lid when battery indicator was at hours later it was at so hour sleep drained of power dont know if thats good or badbut my first impression is that its not as good as advertised power consumption within hours means it can only stand by for days assuming linear power consumption besides the clacky touchpad which is easily fixed the whole unit has superb fit finish edges are very sharp especially around the screen it gives an impression that one may cut oneself easily ive forced my fingertips and palms thru all edges without any cuts i cant say the same for other body parts thoughtry at your own risk high resolution screen is great however its a double-edged sword all clickable menu buttons links become so small that it is difficuult to click them using fingertips this is particularly worse around the corners eg i couuld eaislyy close the window instead of resizing it at upper right corner update i am still finding my ways around win but i can confidently say that if you dont want or dont care about win you should save yourself and look for other excellent ultrabooks that have no touch screens in addition a large responsive and accurate multi-gesture touchpad can be just as effective for win ie about so a touch screen is really just a nice-to-have for win but not a necessity this units touchpad is quite goodso i find myself using the touch screen less and less for productivity work however i use the touch screen almost exclusively for leisure browsing of web sites where typing is not really needed after a few days of using it i can confidently say that one should realistically expect the battery life to be no more than hours if you tweak the power saving configurations you may squeeze another hour or two out of it update noticed that wifi isnt reliable ie disconnected whenever i am at busy or low quality hotspots i have not experienced this with my year old sony laptop i suspect this may have to do with the power management configurationsetting after using the unit extensively for about one week id say the sensitivetouchy keyboard is the only remaining annoyance for me i alsowish it has longer battery life but its a conscious trade-off for such a thin ultrabook overall its a very gorgeous ultrabook with beautiful glass top that you can even serve sushi and sashimi on it  update the intermittent wifi disconnects while on battery can be fixed or minimized by changing the property in advanced power management for wifi adaptor change it from max battery to max performance i am starting to warm up to the win metromodern ui certain activities are just more efficient if you simply lift your armfinger to point click on a touch screen instead of a lift your armfinger onto touchpad b move the mouse cursor to the desired buttonlink and c click or tap the touchpad win definitely requires you to mix match how you use tabletphone and how you use a traditional pclaptop it just takes time to warm up to it of course you need to have a touch screen to take full advantage of win metromodern ui however a touch screen isnt a must for win because you can also change win back to the classic windows interface</th>\n",

       "      <th>i was looking for a lightweight lb or less touch screen windows around the mark laptop for my mom who is a light pc user definitely requiring user support often after purchasing an asus notebook after about hours i was sure this was not the right notebook and i needed to find something better the asus had the centrino processors which turns out run hot so the fan was loud and the laptop would be hot pretty much the whole time and it only had a dual processor even after optimizing it and removing some power consuming apps the poor laptop still seemed to struggle to run plus the screen was tiny not a touch screen hence the price tag after some research attempting to remedy the asus shortcomings i purchased the acer aspire v after going to best buy and actually handling the laptop i was impressed at its weight how slick and well designed it felt and most importantly it felt like a real laptop not a toy like the asus what a great purchase after spending days configuring it and learning the new w os and all these apps ive never handled i am a windows convert and definitely considering buying an acer aspire for myself pros price what a great price for such a loaded laptop paid only a little over design solid notebook slick design with all necessary ports weight light weight about lb with the battery touchpad is a dream you have the mouse click options which are missing on some other notebooks it is sensitive just enough it is not in your way when you type it doesnt jump around your apps when you touch it best of all i did not have to load any additional drivers or updates for the touchpad touch screen although the resolution isnt super high on paper what a great crystal screen love the colors vibrant and clear from the box didnt have to adjust anything and the screen is so well designed for the touch it is sensitive just enough to get you around without many errors in the box laptop power cable basic manual for start up and warranty dongle for vga fan super happy with the low quiet fan and cool laptop all that with a quad processor laptop kudos sound speakers provide loud enough volume for my aging mom with slight hearing issues good clear sound as well unknowns battery dont know have not had the battery below so i dont know how long it would take to drain it performance not sure if this isnt due to everything being new and having to load for the first time but some apps and screens take to seconds to load hoping this would change once everything is configured and used at least once it could also be due to our w inexperience time will tell the laptop does start fast from sleep mode although when you open the top it doesnt start automatically i have to press the power button for it to wake up there is probably a setting somewhere about that but thats not a big issue right now cons probably the only tech spec that is below the rest of the components on this machine is the camera grainy images and video oh well all the rest is great so hard to complain given the price had to install app updates which took several hours the notebook was loaded in nov so by july all loaded apps had new versions pretty much this is not an acer or laptop issue though cant hold it against them since this is something we have to do regardless of what brand and laptop we purchase acercloud is a good idea but boy there was no information about what and how to use it and after loading a bunch of its related apps to the laptop and the mobile devices i had no idea how to move filesphotos from the mobile devices to the laptop just no way to do that based on the few menus in the apps it was super frustrating and even research online on the acer forums was useless after wasting about hours i moved onto skydrive after min and some research it still didnt seem intuitive enough so i did some more experimenting and settled on dropbox what a relief the app came with a short and sweet guide telling me exactly how to load my files from one device to the other and the app itself was pretty intuitive as well and didnt require different apps like the acercloud just one plus it kept giving me more and more free space the more i used it and the more devices i added hope this solves my file sharing needs long term would be great if the touch screen laptops came with a touch pen also makes it so much nicer to browse the screen i used one that came with another purchase i made on amazon again not really an acer issue just a nice to have suggestion other windows bit of a steep learning curve and there were no tutorials or instructions on the laptop or at least not that i easily spotted there is definite initial frustration with the os lasted about days but after installing windows preview version which brings back the start button of sorts after finally finding the control panel it was frustrating hunting for it or accidentally stumbling on it but not knowing how to knowingly get to it i was more and more comfortable with the os and seeing its advantages after moderately learning how to get around myself i setup up the start screen and apps for my mom i then braced myself and showed my mom how to use her new laptop expecting a long drawn session it was quite a surprise to see how well she took to using the touch screen and figured out how to get around she has always had trouble with the mouse pads and even more with the touch pads it was a relief to see that she easily handled the gestures on the screen and learned how to get around surprisingly faster than i expected she loved the screen clarity and the vibrant colors after that i knew i had the right laptop in conclusion i am very impressed with this quiet lightweight hard working crystal clear machine after a bit more tweaking and learning more about the os and the apps i am sure it will be even better will try to provide an update after some longer term use but for now we are definitely in the honeymoon phase</th>\n",

       "      <th>well its expensive more expensive than any tablet option that ive seen but thats also partially because its on par with a full powered ultrabook in terms of specs here are the specific pros and cons i see pros battery life really can hit hours even though its an i gb sata iii ssd with gb ram with the digitizer its powerful enough to be used as a pretty effective graphic design device rip and flip mode is actually pretty handy when using it as a tablet more so than the hinge less surface pro keyboard battery idea is well engineered and works like the asus tablets the tablets battery is always given charge priority over the keyboard docks battery so when both are plugged in the tablet charges while the kb trickle charges once the tablet is full the kb charges at full speed when docked but unplugged the kb powers the device and transfers its juice to the tablet to recharge its battery you can also plug the kb in by itself to charge the kb docks battery while you continue to use the tablet if you really wanted to you could use the tablet indefinitely and never actually plug it directly into the wall if you alternate using it with the kb dock with vpro rapid boot full hibernation takes less than seconds to restore between pressing the power button and actually getting a useable desktop cold boots pretty close to that sleep restore is instant large multitouch touchpad is actually usable and works very well its on par with the touchpad i had on my macbook pro eraser mouse also works well and is a nice alternative to have for apps that dont work well with touchpads such as games like minecraft well-built hinge design is sturdier than any other similar tablets ive used the kb dock has supplemental cooling so when docked it can run the i at full speed fans in the dock blow through vents in the tablet even when not docked its pretty fast supports intel widi so i picked up a couple adapters two usb ports on the kb dock solid overall build quality something lenovo is well known for good quality speakers loud and clear decent sized stylus and that actually goes inside the tablet when not in use unlike the surface pro intel hd isnt the fastest gpu but when paired with a halfway decent cpu itll run just about anything on the ms store flawlessly and most of my steam library on low to medium settings unlike the atom-based tablets which were always a crapshoot when trying new software ive tested it with dishonored fable skyrim far cry blood dragon assassins creed xcom enemy unknown deus ex human revolution arkham city shogun total war and several other current gen games with the exception of any games that specifically have trouble with intel integrated graphics like the swapper it can run pretty much anything i try on it at least at fps if i turn the detail down low enough mini dp instead of micro hdmi like some models such as the samsung ativ cons fully loaded it probably runs about wifi reception is a little odd it picks up g networks great but n network reception drops off significantly the further you get from the router from the other side of the house i get bars to the g network but as few as bar to the n network even though they are both hosted by the same netgear they had similar issues with the early models that my company received a few months back and the lenovo rep told us that a x version would be available sometime in the future but i have no idea specifically when that might be no sd card slot although id rather use a sata iii external usb hard drive over a slow sd card they had to cut it for space in the final design when docked its a little bit larger and heavier than some ultrabooks the only usb port on the tablet is and is covered when docked with the keyboard no usb ports on the tablet itself actually getting widi to work has been unreliable but i dont know where the problem is on that one yet probably software updates no gps on the wifi model included with mobile broadband only compared to other lenovo laptops that feature rapid charge recharging both batteries to full takes a while total charging time seems to take about to hours or to per battery as is the case with all full windows tablets the battery can drain faster than expected if you are not careful too many background apps may drain your battery prematurely but this is more of a general windows complaint than this device specifically no haswell model today and for all anyone knows there could be one in a week or a year now is a terrible time to buy any device because halfway decent haswells are showing up pretty quickly razer already has a haswell gaming laptop with a discrete gpu that weighs less than lbs really nitpicky cons these are cons that i noticed that are very minor boil down to personal preference or havent been verified as being unsolvable so there may be some equivalent featuresolution while the kb can charge when the tablet isnt attached the usb ports dont appear to charge devices plugged into them if the tablet is not present a battery charge indicator on the kb would be nice without this theres no way to know how charged the kb is without plugging the tablet into it some of the keyboard keys are laid out strangely fn in the far lower left instead of ctrl is a pet peeve of mine the bios allows you to swap ctrl and fn in the lower left to compensate for this observations neither good nor bad but interesting to know when the tablet is flipped all kb input from the docked kb is ignored as is the close lid action since folding the unit updoesnt really close it in this mode this means that if you had a specific power setting mapped to lid close then you cant do that until you flip it back around in the other direction</th>\n",
