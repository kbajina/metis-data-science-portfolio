# METIS Data Science Portfolio:

### Overview:
This repository highlights major projects I completed while attending the Metis Data Science program in San Francisco.

## Portfolio Projects Summary:

### [1) Online Mortgage Pre-Approval:](https://github.com/kbajina/metis-data-science-portfolio/tree/master/mortgage-preapproval)
**Objective:**  
Identify mortgage applicants at risk of default using classification algorithms.  

**Motivation:**  
To develop a prototype for an online mortgage pre-approval process.  
For the purposes of this project, a Tableau interactive dashboard was created to mimic a web application.

### [2) Amazon Customer Review Enhancement:](https://github.com/kbajina/metis-data-science-portfolio/tree/master/customer-reviews-enhancement)
**Objective:**  
Improve customer product research on Amazon platform by using NLP to predict the “helpfulness” of an Amazon review, and Topic Modelling to provide reviewers with suggestions to improve the quality of reviews.

**Motivation:**  
The greatest value an online sales platform, such as Amazon, can offer customers (in addition to competitive pricing) is the ability for customers to conudct product research. With such a large user-base for online shopping, the product reviews accessible to potential customers provides immense value, and peice of mind when making a purchase. Improving the overall quality of reviews on the platform will only aid in bettering the experience for customers — allowing them to make more informed decisions when making a purchase.

### [3) Retail Sales Forecasting:](https://github.com/kbajina/metis-data-science-portfolio/tree/master/retail-sales-forecasting)
**Objective:**  
Clustered Walmart retail sales branches to perform weekly sales forecasting using Time Series.  

**Motivation:**  
Forecast sales performance of branches that fall within certain territories, to reflect specific buying behaviours and account for exogenous variables within a region that could impact sales at certain points throughout the year (i.e. unemployment, consumer price index, temperature).
